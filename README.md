# AI-Native Piano Learning Assistant — RAG Ingestion Pipeline

An offline retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) ingestion pipeline that turns
a piano-learning knowledge base into a queryable vector database. Built as
part of [My AI Portfolio](https://github.com/shayeeboy) alongside the
[AI-Native Team Diagnostic](https://github.com/shayeeboy/ai-native-diagnostic).

**Knowledge base (this build):**
| Document | Author | Pages | Type |
|---|---|---|---|
| *Fundamentals of Piano Practice* | Chuan C. Chang | 202 | Method book (technique, practice methods, theory) |
| *The Virtuoso Pianist, Part I* | C. L. Hanon | 21 | Exercise book (20 numbered finger exercises) |

**Result of this run:** 985 chunks (940 + 45) indexed with metadata, ready for embedding and vector search.

## Pipeline

```
Knowledge Base → Document Parsing → Chunking → Chunk Overlap → Embeddings → Metadata → Indexing → Vector Database
```

Each stage is an isolated script in `scripts/`, so any stage can be swapped
(a different embedding model, a different vector DB) without touching the
others. Every stage but the last runs fully offline on this repo's contents —
including embeddings, which use a local model with no API key. Only the final
indexing stage needs network access, for the Neon Postgres database (a
`DATABASE_URL`); no third-party API credentials are required at any stage.

### 1. Knowledge Base

Two source PDFs: `fundamentals-of-piano-practice-readthedocs-io-en-latest.PDF`
and `virtuoso-pianist-pt1-a4.PDF`, placed in `data/uploads/`.

### 2. Document Parsing — `scripts/01_parse.js`

- Extracts text with `pdftotext -layout` (preserves reading order for
  single/multi-column pages).
- Splits on the form-feed character pdftotext inserts between pages, so
  every page keeps its page number — this becomes citation metadata later
  ("Fundamentals of Piano Practice, p.42").
- Cleans line-break hyphenation artifacts (`tech-\nnique` → `technique`)
  and collapses stray whitespace, without destroying paragraph breaks.
- Drops near-empty pages (running headers, blank separators).
- Output: `data/parsed/<doc>.json` — `{ doc_id, title, author, pages: [{ page, text }] }`.

**Result:** 202 usable pages from *Fundamentals*, 21 from *Hanon* (the Hanon
score is mostly musical notation glyphs, which `pdftotext` renders as
unrecognizable symbols — only the surrounding prose per exercise, e.g.
"Nº 3. (2-3-4) Before beginning to practise Nº 3…", is meaningfully
retrievable as text. This is a known limitation for scanned/notation-heavy
PDFs — see *Design decisions* below.)

### 3. Chunking — `scripts/02_chunk.js`

- Sentence-aware chunking: text is split into sentences first, then packed
  greedily into ~1,400-character (~350-token) chunks — never splitting a
  sentence in half.
- Chunk size was chosen to be large enough to keep a full technique
  explanation or exercise instruction intact, small enough for precise
  retrieval and to stay well under typical embedding model input limits.
- Chunks can span a page boundary; `page_start`/`page_end` are tracked so a
  chunk that starts on page 41 and ends on page 42 is still citable.

### 4. Chunk Overlap — (part of `scripts/02_chunk.js`)

- ~200 characters (~15% of chunk size) from the end of each chunk are
  carried into the start of the next.
- Purpose: prevents a technique instruction that lands right at a chunk
  boundary from losing its context — e.g. a sentence like "the thumb should
  pass under smoothly" shouldn't be split from the sentence before it that
  explains *when* to do it.
- Verified on real output: chunk 5 ends "…the most important factor for
  learning to play the piano is the practice methods." and chunk 6 opens
  with that same sentence before continuing — confirming overlap works as
  designed.

### 5. Embeddings — `scripts/04_embed.js`

- Runs a **local embedding model** — `mixedbread-ai/mxbai-embed-large-v1`
  (a BGE-large finetune) — via **Transformers.js** (`@xenova/transformers`).
  No API key, no per-call billing, and no network at inference time after
  the one-time model download. Chunks are embedded in batches of 16 with
  CLS pooling and L2 normalization.
- **Asymmetric retrieval** is preserved: documents are embedded as-is here,
  while queries should be prefixed at retrieval time with the model's
  instruction (`RETRIEVAL_QUERY_PREFIX`, exported from `04_embed.js`) —
  the same document-vs-query asymmetry that improves recall.
- 1,024-dimensional output — a reasonable balance of retrieval quality vs.
  storage/index size for a knowledge base this size (985 chunks), and it
  keeps the `vector(1024)` schema and HNSW index unchanged.
- **Swap-in note:** the model is pluggable via `EMBED_MODEL=...`, and because
  each stage is isolated you can drop in a hosted provider (Voyage AI's
  `voyage-3.5`, OpenAI `text-embedding-3-*`, etc.) by editing only this file
  — adjust `EMBEDDING_DIM` + `sql/schema.sql` if the dimension differs.

### 6. Metadata — `scripts/03_metadata.js`

Runs offline, right after chunking, so metadata is available before the
embedding call (order in the code differs slightly from the diagram for
this reason — see *Design decisions*). Adds per chunk:

- `source_type`: `method-book` vs `exercise-book`
- `content_type`: `exercise` / `technique` / `practice-method` / `theory` /
  `narrative` — keyword-classified
- `skill_level`: `beginner` / `advanced` / `unspecified`
- `finger_numbers`: e.g. `["3-4-5"]`, extracted from Hanon-style notation
  like "(3-4-5)" so a query like "exercises for my weak 4th and 5th finger"
  can filter directly
- `keywords`: lightweight frequency-based keyword extraction for hybrid
  (BM25 + vector) search

**Result on this run:** 354 technique chunks, 243 exercise chunks, 170
practice-method chunks, 150 narrative, 68 theory.

### 7. Indexing — `scripts/05_index.js`

- Idempotent bulk upsert into Postgres: multi-row `INSERT … ON CONFLICT DO
  UPDATE`, batched 100 rows per statement.
- Re-running after a knowledge base update (e.g. adding a third method
  book) only touches changed rows.
- **Requires `DATABASE_URL` (Neon connection string)** — run alongside or
  after the embedding stage.

### 8. Vector Database — Neon Postgres + pgvector

Schema in `sql/schema.sql`:

- `documents` table (one row per source book) and `chunks` table (one row
  per chunk, `embedding vector(1024)` column).
- **HNSW index** on `embedding` with cosine distance — better recall/speed
  tradeoff than IVFFlat for a KB this size, and doesn't need a training
  step before it's usable (IVFFlat needs data present before building the
  index; HNSW builds incrementally).
- B-tree indexes on `doc_id`, `content_type`, `skill_level` for metadata
  pre-filtering (e.g. "only exercises, only Hanon") ahead of vector search.
- Generated `tsvector` column + GIN index for hybrid keyword+vector search.

---

## Design decisions

- **Neon over self-hosted Postgres**: serverless scale-to-zero fits a
  portfolio/demo project's usage pattern (mirrors the same reasoning
  used for `ai-native-diagnostic` v3's backend).
- **pgvector over a dedicated vector DB** (Pinecone, Weaviate): one
  database for both structured metadata and vectors means metadata
  filtering and vector search happen in a single SQL query — simpler
  ops for a KB this size, and Neon has first-class pgvector support.
- **Local embeddings over a paid API**: embeddings run on-device with
  `mixedbread-ai/mxbai-embed-large-v1` via Transformers.js — zero API cost,
  no keys, fully reproducible offline. It's a 1024-dim BGE-large finetune,
  so quality is competitive with hosted options while keeping the schema
  identical. The stage stays provider-agnostic: swapping in a hosted
  embedder (Voyage AI, OpenAI, etc.) touches only `04_embed.js`.
- **Metadata before embeddings in execution order**: the diagram lists
  Embeddings → Metadata, but running metadata extraction first means the
  (comparatively expensive) embedding pass only happens once the chunk
  boundaries and tags are finalized — avoids re-embedding if a metadata
  rule changes.
- **Known limitation — Hanon notation**: `Nº 1` through `Nº 20` are
  primarily musical staff notation, not text. `pdftotext` extracts the
  surrounding instructional prose (fingering guidance, tempo markings,
  practice notes) but not the notes themselves. A future version could
  rasterize each exercise page and use a vision-capable model to describe
  the notation, or link out to the MuseScore/Mutopia source files.

## Running it

```bash
npm install

# offline stages — no network/API keys needed
npm run offline    # parse → chunk (+overlap) → metadata

# embeddings — local model, no API key (first run downloads the model)
npm run embed      # optional: EMBED_MODEL=... to swap the model
